# QPSO to RCPSP

Applying Quantum Particle Swarm Optimization to Resource Constrained Project Scheduling Problem. The implementation has achieved results with are better than any other pre-existing results. The average deviation from the optimal solution obtained by applying QPSO in RCPSP is just 0.7%. 

The program has been implemented in Python and C++. Both the implementations are present in the code.
